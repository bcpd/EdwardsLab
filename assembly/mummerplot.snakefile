"""
A snakefile to make a set of all vs. all pairwise
comparisons using mummer, and plot the images.

To run this snakefile you will need:

    - [mummer](http://mummer.sourceforge.net/)
    - [snakemake](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/)
    - [imagemagick](https://imagemagick.org/index.php) for the montage command
    - probably gnuplot

To run the command, you will need the mummerplot.yaml. I recommend
you copy that to your local directory and use that version of it.

Then you can run this file with

snakemake --configfile mummerplot.yaml mummerplot.snakefile
