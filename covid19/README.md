# Running the code

Simply call it with your flavor of python3 and you will see a plot of the latest data.
There are two main programs:

```bash
python3 nCoV-Viz.py
python3 nCoV-BarGraph.py
```

The programs downloaded the spreadsheet from the above URL and store it locally in Covid-19.csv
To use cached local spreadsheet, use "-l" option

Intermediate data for Cases/Deaths and also for each country are stored in relevant .csv files

All plots can be aligned to :
  First date of detection or death, in that country (default). This allows for comparison of development curves between different countries.
  First date of detection in China, 2019-12-31 (-n)

Data can be plotted as daily values (default) or cumulative values (-c).

Countries to plot and line colours are specified in the appropriate tables at the top of this file.

For full help use the -h command.

The plots can be viewed here, with daily updates : https://johned0.github.io/covid-19/
